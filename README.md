# Physics-engine-for-3dgames
openGl project. im using this as a way to learn opengl by trying to create some physics engine algtough im not yet on the physics part of the project but it is some thiing . please refer to test2.cpp for the new version of the code. i changed the camera system from the first person shooter style since my pith and yaw were being clamped in a way i couldnt see the model from the other side (Front only) to the some form of orbit camera allows you to view the model in different angles and position while the light rotates the object this was for  me to see if the texture was being actually bound correctly and the reflection and the direrction of the reflection works correctly as intended. please refer to the classes folder to see the camera.h what chnages have been made
